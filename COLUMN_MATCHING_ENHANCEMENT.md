# Column Matching Enhancement for Calculated Columns

## Problem

The SQL query completion logic was failing to properly match calculated columns when students and reference solutions used different aliases or no aliases at all. This was causing valid student answers to be marked as incorrect.

### Examples of Issues Fixed:

**Before (Failed):**

- Student: `SELECT quantityOrdered * priceEach FROM OrderDetails`
- Solution: `SELECT quantityOrdered * priceEach AS totalSales FROM OrderDetails`
- Result: ❌ Column names mismatch (`quantityOrdered * priceEach` vs `totalSales`)

**Before (Failed):**

- Student: `SELECT SUM(quantityOrdered * priceEach) AS total FROM OrderDetails`
- Solution: `SELECT SUM(quantityOrdered * priceEach) AS totalSales FROM OrderDetails`
- Result: ❌ Column names mismatch (`total` vs `totalSales`)

## Solution

Enhanced the column matching logic in `src/services/sqlExecutor.js` with a three-pass matching algorithm:

### 1. First Pass: Exact Column Name Matching

- Direct string comparison of column names
- Handles cases where student and solution use identical column names

### 2. Second Pass: SQL Expression Analysis

- Extracts SELECT expressions from both queries using SQL parsing
- Normalizes expressions by removing aliases (`AS aliasName`)
- Compares the underlying SQL expressions
- Handles calculated columns, functions, and complex expressions

### 3. Third Pass: Fallback Normalization

- Normalizes column names for edge cases
- Handles auto-generated MySQL column names

## Key Functions Added

### `extractSelectExpressions(query)`

- Parses SQL SELECT clauses to extract individual expressions
- Handles nested parentheses, quotes, and commas correctly
- Returns array of raw SQL expressions

### `normalizeExpression(expression)`

- Removes `AS alias` clauses from expressions
- Normalizes whitespace and operators
- Converts to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison

### `compareColumnNames(studentColumns, solutionColumns, studentQuery, solutionQuery)`

- Enhanced comparison function using the three-pass algorithm
- Returns detailed results including missing/extra columns

## Test Results

All test cases now pass:

✅ **Fixed Cases:**

- `SELECT expr AS alias1` vs `SELECT expr AS alias2` → **MATCH**
- `SELECT expr` vs `SELECT expr AS alias` → **MATCH**
- `SELECT SUM(expr)` vs `SELECT SUM(expr) AS alias` → **MATCH**
- `SELECT COUNT(*)` vs `SELECT COUNT(*) AS alias` → **MATCH**
- Complex expressions with functions → **MATCH**

❌ **Correctly Rejected:**

- Different mathematical operations (`+` vs `*`)
- Missing columns
- Wrong number of columns

## Files Modified

1. **`src/services/sqlExecutor.js`**

   - Added expression parsing and normalization functions
   - Enhanced `compareColumnNames()` function
   - Updated `compareQueries()` to pass SQL queries for analysis

2. **`src/scripts/test-column-matching.js`** (New)

   - Comprehensive test suite for column matching
   - Tests all common scenarios and edge cases

3. **`package.json`**
   - Added `npm run test-column-matching` script

## Usage

Run the test suite to verify the enhancement:

```bash
npm run test-column-matching
```

## Impact

This enhancement significantly improves the accuracy of the SQL completion detection system, reducing false negatives where students write correct queries but use different aliases or no aliases compared to the reference solution.

Students will now get proper completion credit for:

- Calculated columns with any alias or no alias
- Aggregate functions with any alias or no alias
- Complex expressions regardless of alias naming
- Function calls and mathematical expressions

The system still correctly rejects truly incorrect answers while being more flexible about stylistic differences in alias naming.
